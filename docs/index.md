## **<p style="text-align:center;">Introduction</p>**

In this tutorial, we will walk through the entire Data Science Life Cycle. To illustrate this process, we will focus on how various factors influence the priority of 911 calls in Baltimore. These factors include the district where the crime occurred, the type of crime, and the time of the incident. As you may know, Baltimore is often ranked among the top ten most dangerous cities in the United States. Identifying patterns that directly correlate with high-priority calls could help reduce crime in the city and ultimately improve its safety, potentially removing it from the list of dangerous cities. This is why we chose to use Data Science to identify the key factors behind high-priority calls.

Identifying this pattern is crucial, as it could drive policy changes that make Baltimore a safer community. For instance, discovering that a particular district experiences a higher frequency of high-priority calls than others could result in the allocation of more police resources to that district. Similarly, if a specific crime is more prevalent in Baltimore compared to other cities, targeted policies could be introduced to reduce that crime. Not only would this enhance the quality of life in Baltimore, but it would also lead to more efficient use of existing resources.
